<h2>About</h2>
<p>handouts.ca is a curated collection of handouts for Emergency Department patients from reliable, reputable sources. Compiled by a community based, Canadian Emergency Physician with an interest in eHealth. Good discharge instructions increases patient satisfaction, safety, and reduces medical-legal risk. We want to help make it easier to find quality material to share with your patients.

To be honest, you could find all this stuff with a google search but we that work for you. This is the good stuff, in one place. The idea is to reduce the friction associated with this part of the patient encounter. We will add more as we come across it.</p>

<p>Please review the material before printing and sharing with patients to make sure you agree with the advice in the handout.</p>

<h2>Contributions?</h2>

<p>Have a great handout you use routinely that you'd like to share? Let us know, so we can add it to the list. We prefer "handouts" in PDF format. Send them to us at: <a href="mailto:info@hanouts.ca">info@handouts.ca</a></p> 

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>1. Discharge handouts crowd-sourced by colleagues and peer reviewed. Wikipedia-style. Get in touch if you are interested in contributing or have something to add. Any residents need a QI project? Anyone interested in being part of a review board?

<p>2. Hopefully, a method to deliver these instructions electronically... direct to phones or email. Lets save some trees and create a record that they got the instructions.</p>

<p>3. A one-stop site for patients with good quality videos, apps and other resources compiled by Canadian Emergency Physicians.</p>

<h2>Conflicts to declare?</h2>
<p>None. This is a non-profit passion project. No drug company money.</p>

<h2>Concerns? Complaints? Suggestions? Compliments? Collaborators?</h2>

<p>You can find us here:  <a href="mailto:chisholm.mirror@gmail.com">info@handouts.ca</a></p>
